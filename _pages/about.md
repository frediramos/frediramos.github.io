Greetings, my name is Frederico Ramos and I am a PhD student in computer science at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en">Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://web.ist.utl.pt/jose.fragoso">José Fragoso Santos</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~padao/">Pedro Adão</a>. I am currently working on the synthesis of tool-independent summaries for symbolic execution. My main research interests are cybersecurity, formal methods and programming languages.

I am also a junior researcher at <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt">INESC-ID</a>, studying the application of software verification tools to student's code as part of their learning process in undergraduate courses.



In December 2021 I completed my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at IST. My dissertation, entitled <i><a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/1128253548922710">Toward Tool-Independent Summaries for Symbolic Execution</a></i>, was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://web.ist.utl.pt/jose.fragoso">José Fragoso Santos</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~padao/">Pedro Adão</a>.
