Welcome. My name is Frederico, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en">Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://web.ist.utl.pt/jose.fragoso">José Fragoso Santos</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~padao/">Pedro Adão</a>. I also work as a researcher in the <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/research-areas/automated-reasoning-and-software-reliability/">ARSR Group</a> at INESC-ID.

My research focuses on optimizing symbolic execution through techniques such as symbolic summaries, memory models, and path merging, with a current emphasis on C and JavaScript. These approaches aim to make analyses more scalable and precise.

I am broadly interested in formal methods, and programming languages, exploring how these areas intersect to improve software reliability and security.

<!-- In December 2021, I completed my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at IST.
My dissertation titled <i><a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/1128253548922710">Toward Tool-Independent Summaries for Symbolic Execution</a></i> laid the groundwork for my current research. -->
