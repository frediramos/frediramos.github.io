  title={Toward Tool-Independent Summaries for Symbolic Execution},
  author={Frederico Duarte Ramos},
  abstract={Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique that has been successfully used to find various
            types of bugs in industrial codebases. Despite being extensively used in practice, this technique suffers
            from two main limitations when applied to real-world code: path explosion and interactions with the
            runtime environment. To address both of these problems, current symbolic execution engines make use
            of symbolic summaries. These interact with the symbolic state of a given program so as to simulate the
            behaviour of both external and internal functions without having to symbolically execute them. Symbolic
            summaries can therefore be used to mitigate the number of paths explored and also allow for the analysis
            of external calls. Despite their advantages, there is a clear lack of mechanisms for sharing symbolic
            summaries across different tools and for their uniform validation.
            In this thesis we introduce a methodology for implementing tool-independent symbolic summaries for
            the C programming language. This methodology consists of an API containing a set of symbolic reflec-
            tion primitives for explicit manipulation of C symbolic states. Symbolic summaries implemented using
            our API can be shared across different symbolic execution tools, provided that these tools implement
            the proposed API. Additionally, due to being written directly in C, these summaries can themselves be
            symbolically executed as standard C code. Hence, we also introduce a summary validation tool that can
            systematically evaluate the correctness of a symbolic summary with respect to its concrete reference
            implementation.},
